## zeta 

- zeta.nvim was original home to the diff algorithms and tests
- there are still plenty of "learning" files over there, if needed
  - only move if useful here

## diff_match_patch

- stumbled on this gem!
- https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/blob/master/lua/diff_match_patch.lua
- allegedly fast and implemented in many languages
- lots of test cases too
