## Examples

These are patch files that I find interesting. That I might use for future testing and/or feature development of diffs.

## Notes


Some of these have a corresponding recording, see `streaming-diff-patch-corresponding-videos-rug` directory

- ./add-ratio-column.patch
  - Might consider non-whitespace split characters too (or in some cases instead of whitespace?)
    Not a huge deal but the second row of the table has no whitespace so it was a bit odd to display
    That said everything appeared fine, even in diff view
  - Separately, I saw some instability (nothing worth changing anything)
    - Just a note so I can revisit if I investigate and/or make changes due to that in the future.
